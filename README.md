# DC

https://ptorini1.github.io/dc-comics-parody-webiste/

It was our first project in System Development course at SENAI MANUEL GARCIA FILHO.

We had to develop a DC's website parody so we decided to make some fun. 

I developed the movies page and helped a lot in the home page as well. As it was the first project, please do not expect that much :)

Project Group: @Sarasouss, Yasmin, Marcos Pastor, Webson and me.
